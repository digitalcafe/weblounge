 * This interface defines common methods and fields for composeable objects like

 * <p>
 * A <code>Composeable</code> is an object that is being rendered as a response
 * or a part of a response to a request. When the Composeable represents a
 * response part only, it might want to place include instructions into the
 * <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the enclosing <code>HTML</code> page. To
 * do this, it just needs to return these includes in {@link #getHTMLHeaders()}
 * and {@link #getScripts()}.
 * <p>
 * Composeables are usually used to display content to the user. Often, this
 * content might become invalid and needs to be recalculated in some way. The
 * composeable can indicate this to the system by returning proper values in
 * {@link #getCacheExpirationTime()} and {@link #getClientRevalidationTime()}.
